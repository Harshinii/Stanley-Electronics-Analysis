# Recommendations:
Based on the insights and findings above, it is recommended that Stanley’s teams to consider the following:
•	Focus on High-Margin Products: Invest in marketing and inventory of best-selling products in computers and home appliances categories.
•	Expand Successful Stores: Consider upsizing or replicating successful large-format stores in high-performing regions.
•	Enhance Customer Loyalty: Introduce loyalty programs to incentivize repeat purchases, especially for the 18-34 demographic.
•	Strengthen Online Channel: There is scope to further develop the e-commerce platform, including targeted promotions based on geography and age segmentation to increase sales overall.

# Assumptions and Caveats:
Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:
Assumption 1: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens
Assumption 2: customer birthdates were all assumed to be in mm/dd/yyyy formats despite the countries they belonged to.
Assumption 3:  because 3% of the order date date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis
