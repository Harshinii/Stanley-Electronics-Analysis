4.	Strengthen Online Channel: There is scope to further develop the e-commerce platform, including targeted promotions based on geography and age segmentation to increase sales overall.

# Assumptions and Caveats:
Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:
1. Assumption 1: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens
2. Assumption 2: customer birthdates were all assumed to be in mm/dd/yyyy formats despite the countries they belonged to.
3. Assumption 3:  because 3% of the order date date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis
